# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Project using HTML and CSS:- 

My theme of the project is MSIT journey. It is the extended version of the second day assignment about the Msit journey web page.

Description:
In this web page, I am going to discuss about my experience in MSIT and my hobbies with images and text.

1. I have added 4 more pages to it such as My academic experience, skills, memories and favoruite hobbie.

2. I have implemented pages such that we can navigate from any page to any page.

3. I have implemented all the tags that are mentioned in the project0 requirements.

4. Especially, the bootstrap grid mode is applied to the second and 4th pages where there are images and text written in columns of memories and Academic experience pages.

5. There are totally five files: index.html,My-Academic-Experience.html,My-Memories.html,My-Skills.html,Favhobby.html and mystyle.css.

6. I also implemented media tag for every page, such that if it is accessed in mobile or smaller screen it will change its appearance.
